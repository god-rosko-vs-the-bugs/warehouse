* Features to implemnet
** Gnu-stow-ish features to implement
*** Default usecase
*** Have a file with symlinks made with the program
*** Have git diagnostics like - branch
*** Can "stash" configs or link them to external paths for experimentation
*** check for symlinks that are broken/changed

** Repo-ish command
*** very Bare bones repo command
*** Downloads a "manifest" when inited (might use curl, or just http client)
**** Maybe get up a http server at home for that "Manifest Thingy"
**** executes git clone and other git commands in the folders in its root (recursively)
**** do version control
*** That feture will be accessed by a separate parameter (maybe --get="some
*** url" -g="some url")
